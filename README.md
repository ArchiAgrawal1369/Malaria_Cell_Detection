# Malaria_Detection

Malaria has been one of the major causes of death in Africa and being able to classify malaria-infected cell images is pivotal to the quick diagnosis of Malaria.
The project ‘Malaria Detection’ is based on the concept of transfer learning and Convolution Neural Networks (CNN).
It predicts whether the given input image of the cell of a human being is parasitized or uninfected.
